- The initial analysis folder - can be ignored, as this is the EDA done only on my YouTube channel. 
- The data collection folder - includes the jupyter notebook for the data collection of the 4 YouTube channels.
- The YouTube Modelling with R folder - is the important folder with all the analysis done in R (and have generated the html file in quarto here), this folder also contains the EDAV app source code as well (in another folder).
